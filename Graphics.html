        <h1>Graphics Design</h1>
        <p>Students will be taught how to use Figma, a free design<br>
        software to help them develop their own UI(User Interface) for<br>
        their various projects.<br>
        Students will also be taught how to use Photoshop which most of us<br>
        have heard of but don't know how to use it. We will be able to create<br>
        beautiful and attractive designs using Photoshop after the training.
