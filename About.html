        <p>
        <strong>Rev<span>Devs</span></strong> is a newly developed website to help in promoting Blue Code Hack Club to the world.<br>
        Blue Code Hack Club is training students into the I.T and Computer Science fields in the <br>
        world. This website is not hosted on the internet as it is just a project built by Solomon <br>
        Cudjoe a student in the University of Ghana pursuing BSc in Information Technology(I.T).<br>
        I am an amateur in coding and web development if you are viewing this website and you wish to<br>
        train me to become a pro I will be very grateful. I am a level 100 student now going to level<br>
        200 and I want to be a web developer, network engineer and also get some knowledge in application<br>
        development.
